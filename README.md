# MIDAS-Internship
Hello reader

Here I have used Machine Learning algorithms to predict the category of a product using its description.

I have used only 1 feature because I am assuming that all the other data will not be able to be filled in a dynamic form which is based on events.
The only correct information that we have is the description.

Product specification is not used because here they may not be able to provide clear picture 

<h2> We can improve </h2>
By :
Using image data we can improve the model and create and ensemble of both
Using product reviews as well. They too may provide some clues

<h2> For visualization </h2> 
we can have a wordcloud, confusion matrix, barplots indicating most used words.
